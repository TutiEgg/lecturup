Originally created by Steve Francia in 2013, Hugo has seen a great increase in both features and performance thanks to current lead developer Bjørn Erik Pedersen (since v0.14 in 2015) and other contributors. Hugo is an open source project licensed under the Apache License 2.0.\n\nBeing able to generate most websites within seconds (at < 1 ms per page), Hugo's official website states it is \"the world’s fastest framework for building websites\". In July 2015, Netlify began providing Hugo hosting,and in 2017, Smashing Magazine completed its redesign of their website, migrating from WordPress to a JAMstack solution with Hugo.\n\n# Features\nHugo takes data files, i18n bundles, configuration, templates for layouts, static files, and content written in Markdown, AsciiDoctor, or Org-mode and renders a static website. Some notable features are multilingual support, image processing, custom output formats, and shortcodes. Nested sections allow for different types of content to be separated. E.g. for a website containing a blog and a podcast."},"__N_SSG":true}
